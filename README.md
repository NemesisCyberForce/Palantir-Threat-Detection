### **Disclaimer**

This repository is intended **for educational and research purposes only**.
It is **not** a 100% protection against Palantir-related activity or any other advanced threats.
Security is about **reducing risk**, not eliminating it.

### **1. Background & Mission**

Technology is never neutral. This project was born from that understanding.

Powerful data analysis and surveillance technology, like that developed by Palantir, is now a globally traded commodity. It is sold to governments and organizations with little to no ethical oversight regarding their human rights records or political objectives. In the hands of democratic states, it promises security. In the hands of authoritarian regimes, it becomes a weapon for the oppression of minorities, journalists, and political dissenters.

**This fundamental imbalance of power is the reason this repository exists.**

Our mission is to help level the playing field. We provide **open-source tools and hands-on labs** to detect the digital fingerprints of these powerful surveillance platforms. By using vendor-agnostic **Sigma rules** and free **SIEM platforms**, we make these detection capabilities accessible to everyone—not just those with nation-state budgets.

This is more than a technical exercise; it is an act of **digital transparency**. The goal is to **empower security analysts, researchers, and defenders** to recognize these patterns, understand their implications, and hold powerful actors accountable. We believe that the best defense against the abuse of surveillance technology is a well-informed, prepared, and ethically-minded community.

### **2. SIEM Basics**

**Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)** tools collect, normalize, and analyze logs from multiple sources (firewalls, servers, endpoints).
Popular options:

* **Elastic Security** – Open source, flexible.
* **Splunk Free** – Industry standard, free tier (500 MB/day).
* **Wazuh** – All-in-one open-source XDR.

**Implementation:**
```yaml
title: Known POLiS JA3 Fingerprint
logsource:
  category: firewall

  selection:
    ja3_hash: 'a387c3a7a4d...'  # Example fingerprint
  condition: selection
level: high
```

**Tools to capture JA3:**
- Suricata with `ja3` keyword
- Zeek with `JA3` script
- Custom Python: `pip install ja3er`

---

### **8. Sigma Rule Generator**
Create custom detection rules for white-labeled instances:

```python
# tools/generate_sigma.py
agency = input("Agency name: ")
codename = input("Cover name: ")
signature = input("Unique signature (JA3/path/etc): ")

sigma_rule = f"""
title: {agency} {codename} Detection
logsource:
  category: network
detection:
  selection:
    http.user_agent: '*{codename}*'
    ja3_hash: '{signature}'  # Use strongest available indicator
  condition: selection
level: critical
"""

print(f"Generated rule:\n{sigma_rule}")
```

---

### **9. Test Data Simulation**

#### Basic Python Simulator:
```python
# tools/simulate_palantir.py
import requests, time

target_url = "https://gotham.palantir.com/beacon"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Palantir-Custom-Agent/1.0"}

while True:
    requests.post(target_url, headers=headers, data="SIMULATED")
    time.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes
```

#### Advanced Simulation:
```bash
docker run -it --rm palantir-simulator:latest
```
